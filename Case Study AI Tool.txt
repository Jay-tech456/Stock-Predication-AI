Case Study I: 


        When Apple was lowest, Capgemini was higher and continued to fall.


        There was a day when the price of the stock was the same as the highest peak. 


If I got a notification that it was going to fall (as a prediction) I would have sold my shares at that time and made a huge profit




Case Study II: 
        When Plug was $4 a share back in 2020, it continued to climb to $60 dollars. 


        Since $4 a share was at its highest, this was considered a wildcard to continue to hold
        given the data was still new. 


        4 months later, Plug climbed to $75.
        
        Had I got a recommendation that Plug is at its 52 Week highest, I would have kept it. 
        




Case Study III: 
        When JCPenny declared bankruptcy, its stocks continued to plunge badly.


        Even though the AI tool did not have access to current events; it made a rational
        rational recommendation to sell the shares given the data. 


        If the owner of JCPenny shares got an SMS to sell the shares, they would not lose that
        that much income
